Abstract

    This draft describes a URL scheme intended for connecting securely
    to servers on a local network. It differs from the https scheme in
    that it includes the fingerprint of the TLS certificate with which
    the server's TLS certificate was signed, and is restricted to
    local domainnames.

1.  Introduction

    The https URL scheme is useful for securely connecting to public
    internet servers. On local networks, self-signed certificates
    require a user to visually check the fingerprint of the signing
    certificate, and the process of adding the certificate to the
    client's list of trusted certificates is cumbersome.

    This internet draft proposes the 'httpl' URL scheme to make this
    easier for the user, and remove the risk of human errors when
    checking the certificate's fingerprint.

2. Terminology

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [WORDS].

    "SHOULD" and "SHOULD NOT" are appropriate when valid exceptions to a
    general requirement are known to exist or appear to exist, and it is
    infeasible or impractical to enumerate all of them.  However, they
    should not be interpreted as permitting implementors to fail to
    implement the general requirement when such failure would result in
    interoperability failure.

3. Format

    A httpl URL consist of the following parts:

Internet-Draft                  httpl                      February 2016


      "httpl:sha256-hex:" + <fingerprint> + "//"
          + [ <domain name> | <IP address> ] + <path>

    The <fingerprint> should be the SHA-256 hash of the signing
    certificate provided by the web server, in hexadecimal format.
    Example URL:

    httpl:sha256-hex:30153418F09DDFDF32B445B1254B331EB7D9257BC3797F \
    C2AF95BFA1866999FE//printer.local/index.html

    We define a one-to-one mapping between a httpl URL and its
    "corresponding https URL". To convert a httpl URL to its
    corresponding https URL, replace the parts before the double slash
    with the string "https:". To convert a https URL to its
    corresponding httpl URL, replace the string "https:" with
    "httpl:sha256-hex:" + <fingerprint>, with <fingerprint> as defined
    above.

    The string "sha256" refers to the hashing algorithm with which the
    fingerprint was generated, and the string "hex" refers to the
    format in which the fingerprint is represented. This scheme may be
    extended to allow for other hashing algorithms and representation
    formats.

4. Usage

    To retrieve and present the resource indicated by a httpl URL,
    retrieve the resource indicated by its corresponding https URL,
    and check that the TLS certificate presented by the server is
    signed with a signing certificate, this signing certificate is also
    present in the certificate chain presented by the server, and when
    converted to a hexadecimal number, its SHA-256 hash corresponds to
    the one specified in the URL.

    If the fingerprint checks fails, clients MUST NOT retrieve the
    resource requested, and present an error message.

    Servers that are publically addressable should be referred to with
    https URLs, so that clients can use the CA PKI to check the
    certificate. The httpl scheme should only be used for servers that
    are not publically addressable, and therefore cannot get their TLS
    signed by a certificate authority.

    The URL contains either a domain name or an IP address. In the
    domain name case, the client SHOULD NOT retrieve the resource if
    the domain name falls under the DNS root zone, and display an error
    message instead. In the IP address case, the client SHOULD NOT
    retrieve the resource if the IP address lies outside the Private
    Address Space (for IPv4, see RFC1918 Section 3; for IPv6, see
    RFC4193 Section 3).

5. Security Considerations

    An attacker could create a signing certificate whose SHA-256 hash
    is identical to the one mentioned in the URL. However, this is
    currently not considered technically feasible (right?).

    There is no way to revoke a certificate, so that might be a
    problem.

    It is possible to update the TLS certificate of the server without
    changing the URL, but when the signing certificate is updated, the
    URL changes. This means that the manufacturer or administrator of
    the server should be extra careful not to lose the signing
    certificate, in case there is a future need to update the server's
    TLS certificate without changing the URLs this server can be
    addressed on.

    The manufacturer or administrator of the server SHOULD NOT sign the
    TLS certificate on the server itself, and the private key of the
    signing certificate SHOULD stay on a trusted computer which is not
    connected to any (public) network.

    As mentioned in section 4, the httpl scheme SHOULD NOT be used for
    addressing resources on servers that are connected to the global
    internet; the https scheme already covers that use case in a better
    way. The httpl scheme is strictly intended for use inside local
    networks (the 'l' in 'httpl' refers to 'local').

6. IANA Considerations

    This document registers the 'httpl' URL scheme.
